## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
* Other products that Afterpay can improve upon to have an advantage over their competitors would is improving their Pulse Rewards program. Klarna, for example, has Vibe, which allows shoppers to earn "vibes" when they shop with Klarna. Shoppers earn 1 vibe for every $1 spent, no matter the store, which they can then redeem for gift cards. [Source: Digital Magazine](https://www.borndigital.com/2020/06/09/klarna-launches-buy-now-pay-later-rewards-program) 

* While Afterpay already has Pulse Rewards where shoppers are rewarded for having a streak of timely payments. [Source: Pulse](https://www.afterpay.com/loyalty-opt-in) They can add a component to their rewards program in the form of loyalty points where shoppers can accumulate personalized dicounts and points that they can redeem for higher-valued gift cards they can use at any of the many Retailers Afterpay is partnered with. 

#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* While the current Pulse rewards program is marketed as it is "rewarding responsible spending", the current program seems more of an attempt of trying to recover money rather than rewarding all the customers for using the service. 

* Offering an improved, more inclusive, loyalty program service would give Afterpay benefit the company because it would provide shoppers with a good incentive to use Afterpay over other buy now, pay later providers. Since paying in four installments is now offered by many providers, it is important that companies offer perks to incentivize customer loyalty. 

#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* This additional service can utilize AI and Machine Learning to improve customer loyalty. 

#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* These technologies are appropriate for the aforementioned solution because loyalty programs would allow the company to record data on a shopper's behavior. Machine learning algorithms can look at the shopper's previous buying patters in order to make suggestions and potentially even predict their future actions and/or behaviors.
